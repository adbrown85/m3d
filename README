M3d - Math for 3D graphics

M3d supplies mathematical structures, including vectors, matrices, and
quaternions, necessary for doing 3D graphics.  Currently all operations are
done in double-precision, but utility methods are provided for converting to
both float and double arrays, making it easy to use the structures with other
libraries and technologies.  Implementations are kept simple, and test cases
have been written to verify their integrity.

To install M3d, see the INSTALL document.  For a rundown on the changes between
versions, see the NEWS document.  Lastly, if you want to experiment with the
code or contribute new features or fixes, please see the HACKING document.
