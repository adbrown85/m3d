To install M3d from a distribution, first make sure you have the necessary
tools and dependencies installed.  You will need g++, GNU Make, and CppUnit
[1].  Windows users will need to install a Bourne-compatible shell, like the
one provided with MinGW [2].

Then extract the archive and execute the following three commands:

    ./configure
    make
    make install

Unix-based operating systems such as Linux and Mac OS X may need to provide
administrator privileges to install M3d in the default directory.  On Mac OS X
and Ubuntu, precede the install command with 'sudo' as shown below.

    sudo make install

The installation directory that M3d is installed into can be modified by
specifying the 'prefix' option to the configure script.

    ./configure --prefix=$HOME

To make sure M3d is working as expected, execute the command below.  If it
completes without error, M3d should be ready to go.

    make check

Once M3d is installed, it may easily be included in a project by using
pkg-config [3].  It will report the flags needed to compile and link M3d with
your project.  Use backticks to pass its output to your compiler.  The example
below builds a program that has M3d as a dependency.

    g++ `pkg-config --cflags --libs m3d-0` MyApp.cxx -o MyApp

To generate documentation, make sure Doxygen [4] is installed and then run the
command below.

    make html

Finally, M3d can be uninstalled by running the command below.

    make uninstall
